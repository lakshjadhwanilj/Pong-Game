# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: This is the main entry point of the game. It sets up the game screen, creates the paddles, the ball, and the scoreboard, and controls the game flow.
- `paddle.py`: This file defines the `Paddle` class, which is used to create and control the paddles.
- `ball.py`: This file defines the `Ball` class, which is used to create and control the ball.
- `scoreboard.py`: This file defines the `Scoreboard` class, which is used to display the current score.

## How to Run

To run the game, simply execute the `main.py` script with Python 3.

```bash
python3 main.py
Controls
The left paddle is controlled with the 'w' (up) and 's' (down) keys.
The right paddle is controlled with the 'Up' (up) and 'Down' (down) keys.
